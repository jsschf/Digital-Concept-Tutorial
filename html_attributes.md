# HTML Attributes
- Previously you learned about HTML elements.
- Attributes are used to provide additional information about an HTML element.
- Attributes are defined inside the start tag of an element.
  - ex. `<p style="color: blue">Hello World</p>`
- They usually come in name=value pairs.
  - ex. style="color: blue"
- Not all elements have attributes, and most attributes are specific to that element.
